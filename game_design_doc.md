├── CollisionShapes (walls, boundaries)
├── Interactables (Area2D nodes)
├── SpawnPoints (Marker2D nodes)
└── Exits/Doors (Area2D)
```

**Basic Implementation:**

- Prompt UI (e.g., "Press E to examine")
- Trigger events on interaction

**Key Components:**
```
Interactable (Area2D)
├── CollisionShape2D
├── Sprite2D (object visual)
└── Script (interaction logic)
```

**Basic Implementation:**
- Use Area2D for interaction zones
- Detect when player enters area with `body_entered` signal
- Show prompt when player is near
- Execute interaction on key press (E, Space, etc.)
- Use signals to communicate with dialogue system

**Resources:**
- [Area2D Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_area2d.html)
- [Signals Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html)

### 2.2 Dialogue System
**What you need to implement:**
- Dialogue box UI
- Text display with typewriter effect

- Choice system (for branching dialogue)

**Key Components:**
```
DialogueBox (CanvasLayer)
├── Panel (background)
├── Label (for text)
├── TextureRect (character portrait)
├── ChoiceContainer (VBoxContainer for choices)
└── Script (dialogue manager)
```

**Basic Implementation Options:**

**Option A: Simple Custom System**
- Store dialogue as JSON or Dictionary arrays
- Typewriter effect using timer or tween
- Progress dialogue on key press
- Handle choices with buttons

**Option B: Use Dialogue Plugin**
- Install "Dialogue Manager" addon from Asset Library
- Much faster setup, handles branching

**Resources:**

### 2.3 Sound Effects System
**What you need to implement:**
- Audio players for SFX and music
- Play sounds on interactions
- Footstep sounds during movement
- Ambient room audio

**Key Components:**
```
AudioManager (Autoload)
└── Multiple AudioStreamPlayer nodes
```

**Basic Implementation:**
- Create singleton AudioManager script
- Use AudioStreamPlayer for SFX, AudioStreamPlayer2D for positional sound
- Pool audio players or create dynamically
- Simple function: `AudioManager.play_sfx("sound_name")`

**Resources:**
- [Audio System Overview](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/audio/audio_streams.html)
- [AudioStreamPlayer Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_audiostreamplayer.html)

## Phase 3: Game Systems (Week 3)

### 3.1 Inventory System
**What you need to implement:**
- Data structure to hold items
- Inventory UI (grid or list)
- Add/remove items
- Item examination
- Using items (combining, using on objects)

**Key Components:**
```
InventoryManager (Autoload)
└── items: Array[Dictionary]

InventoryUI (CanvasLayer)
├── ItemGrid (GridContainer)
└── ItemSlots (TextureButton nodes)
```

**Basic Implementation:**
- Store inventory as array in autoload singleton
- Each item is a Dictionary: `{id, name, icon, description}`
- UI displays item icons in grid
- Click item to select, click object to use
- Save inventory data to player save file

**Resources:**
- [Custom Resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html)
- YouTube: "Godot Inventory System Tutorial"
- Consider: Simple array vs Resource-based system

---

### 3.2 Quest/Objective System
**What you need to implement:**
- Quest data structure
- Quest log UI
- Quest progression tracking
- Quest completion triggers

**Key Components:**
```
QuestManager (Autoload)
└── active_quests: Array[Dictionary]

QuestUI (CanvasLayer)
├── ObjectivesList (VBoxContainer)
└── ObjectiveLabel nodes
```

**Basic Implementation:**
- Track quest states: not_started, in_progress, completed
- Quest Dictionary: `{id, title, objectives: Array, state}`
- Update objectives through events/signals
- Display current objectives in UI (always visible or toggle)

**Resources:**
- Similar to inventory system conceptually
- Use signals to communicate quest progress
- YouTube: "Godot Quest System Tutorial"

---

### 3.3 Save/Load System
**What you need to implement:**
- Save game state to file
- Load game state
- Save: player position, inventory, quest progress, room states

**Basic Implementation:**
- Use JSON or ConfigFile
- Save to `user://` path (Linux: `~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/[project_name]/`)
- Create SaveManager autoload
- Save dictionary with all game state
- Load and restore state on game start

**Key Data to Save:**
```gdscript
{
  "player": {
    "current_room": "res://scenes/rooms/bedroom.tscn",
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200}
  },
  "inventory": [...],
  "quests": [...],
  "flags": {...}  # for story progression
}
```

## Phase 4: Polish & Content (Week 4)

### 4.1 Main Menu & UI
- Title screen
- New Game / Continue / Settings
- Pause menu
- Settings (volume, fullscreen)

### 4.2 Cutscene System
**Basic Implementation:**
- Sequence of dialogue + sprite changes
- Camera movements
- Triggered by story events
- Can pause player movement

**Simple Approach:**
- Use AnimationPlayer node
- Animate sprite positions, camera, dialogue triggers
- Disable player input during cutscene

### 4.3 Game Flags System
**What it does:**
- Track story progression
- Remember if events have occurred
- Conditional dialogue/interactions

**Implementation:**
- Simple Dictionary in autoload: `{"met_character_1": true, "solved_puzzle_1": false}`
- Check flags before showing dialogue/interactions

---

## Essential Autoload Singletons Structure

Create these as autoloads (Project Settings > Autoload):

1. **GameManager.gd** - Overall game state, scene transitions
2. **DialogueManager.gd** - Handle all dialogue
3. **InventoryManager.gd** - Item management
4. **QuestManager.gd** - Quest tracking
5. **AudioManager.gd** - Sound/music control
6. **SaveManager.gd** - Save/load functionality

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Get one room working perfectly before adding complexity
2. **Use Signals**: They're Godot's superpower for clean communication
3. **Prototype Ugly**: Focus on functionality first, art later
4. **Save Often**: Use Git for version control
5. **Test on Target Platform**: Run on Linux regularly
6. **Comment Your Code**: Future you will thank you
7. **Use the Debugger**: Godot's debugger is excellent

## Minimal Viable Prototype Checklist

- [ ] Player can move in one room
- [ ] Player can transition between 2 rooms
- [ ] Player can interact with one object
- [ ] One dialogue sequence works
- [ ] One sound effect plays
- [ ] Inventory can hold one item
- [ ] One simple objective displays
- [ ] Game can save and load

Once you have these 8 things working, you have a solid foundation to build your full game!

**Good luck! Godot is perfect for this on Linux. Start with movement and rooms, then build up from there. The community is super helpful if you get stuck.**
